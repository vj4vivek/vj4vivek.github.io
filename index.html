                                Lionel Messi is also known as the GOAT of football.
                                I have been an ardent fan of his ever since I started watching La Liga
                                matches in my hostel during my bachelor days.What I love the most about him is his immense talent and his hardwork.The sheer dedication and effort he
                                puts in his training and matches is incredible.There are many athletes who have the same mentality and work ethics as him but what separates Messi from the 
                                rest is his humility.Despite being a global superstar of the sport and a legend,he is very humble and a nice person.His personal life and friendships with 
                                Suarez or Aguero is very cordial and warm.I am priviledged to live in his era and watch him play.I fear the day he hangs up his boots.Football will go on but it
                                will not remain the same without him.The joy that he brings to his fan's hearts is incredible.
